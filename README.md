## Program Overview

**1. Unique Email IDs:** The system ensures that both customers and employees have unique email IDs upon registration.

**2. Average User Record:** Upon registration, each new user receives an average user record based on all existing users.

**3. Renting Restrictions:** Users can rent cars without limits, but restrictions may apply if a car becomes unavailable or if a user's record is poor.

**4. Late Return Fine:** Returning a car late incurs a fine of 2 user record points per day for both customers and employees.

**5. Purchase Deduction:** Buying a car deducts 1 record point from the user's account.

**6. Dues Clearance:** Users can clear dues only when their record allows it.

**7. Distinct Databases:** Separate databases ensure clear data distinction and easy access.

**8. Manager's Authority:** The manager has comprehensive control over updating, deleting, and creating entities within the system.

**9. Singular Manager:** Currently, only one manager is permitted, but minor changes could involve multiple manager IDs.

**10. Robustness:** The program is designed to handle most edge cases, and suspicious user actions won't disrupt its functionality.
